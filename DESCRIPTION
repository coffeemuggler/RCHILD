Description: The CHILD (Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development) model is a numerical landscape evolution model (LEM). Basic
             information about CHILD and the capabilites are explained in Tucker et al. (2001). The model is operated as a compiled 
             program from the command line, in combination with an input file (*.in). This input file comprises all
             modell parameters. CHILD produces no graphical output but delivers a series of ASCII-files with numerical output (for  
             details see Tucker, 2010).\cr
             In order to work with this model more flexible, to dynamically change input parameters and run the modified model, to create 
             visual output such as variable plots, surface maps or surface animations, and to establish a link between CHILD and other 
             software for spatial data analysis, this package provides general functions. Many of the functions are based on the 
             Matlab-scripts available at the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS, 2012) and greatly benefited from frequent 
             support by founders and users of CHILD.\cr\cr
